## Arrays
* In Java, once you create an array, you cannot change the size.
* In Java, all array element must have the same type.
* element - the individual values in an array
* index - the numbered position of an element (starts at 0)
* length - the number of elements in an array. (the index of the last element + 1)
* jagged array - a multi-dimensional array that may have different numbers of columns in different rows
* rectangular array - 2D array where all the rows have the same number of columns
* enhanced for loop - know how to write an enhanced for loop to access all elements of an array in order. (Cannot use it to access the indexes.)
* When an array is created, Java automatically fills it with default values: e.g. null, 0, false
* Arrays are a reference type.
* `java.util.Arrays` a utility class. Includes `fill`, `toString`, `copyOf`, `equals`.

`==` for reference types checks for *identity* not equivalence.
